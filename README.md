# Face-Recognition-OpenCV-


The aim of the project is to create a program that is capable of detecting and identifying different faces in images, maybe within videos or even through webcams and
blurring some faces depending on some conditions such as people privacy. 

The program for face recognition passes through 3 fundamental phases: data processing, analyzing and training, face detection, and face recognition.
Our program will also have other additional features like blurring specific faces depending on some conditions. 

In the first phase, the data have to be large and various enough so the algorithm can learn their features extremely well. 
In our case, the data are images in general. Using deep learning techniques, the first phase of the project can be completed and move the program to the next phase.

In the second part of the program, the goal is to detect and observe faces in images and draw shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) around the spotted faces to
distinguish them from other objects in the images. Using libraries like OpenCV and Keras, face detection phase is performed in an efficient manner.

In the third phase of the program to be completed, face recognition is applied. 
By providing the program with pre-labeled face images, recognizing the identities of these persons on completely new images, which the program has not seen before,is to be possible.

Lastly, in the fourth phase, censoring and blurring some faces is applied. 
Informing the program by those identities beforehand will help it later in blurring them in efficient manner.
